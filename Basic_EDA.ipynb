Finally, build high-quality and reliable AI!', 'url': 'https://www.producthunt.com/posts/wordware-yc-s24?utm_campaign=producthunt-api&utm_medium=api-v2&utm_source=Application%3A+Kartik+%28ID%3A+138086%29', 'votesCount': 7390, 'createdAt': '2024-08-02T07:01:00Z', 'tagline': 'Your tool for building AI agents with natural language', 'commentsCount': 172, 'comments': {'nodes': [{'body': 'üëãüèª Hi Product Hunt makers!\\n\\nI‚Äôm Kamil, Head of Growth at Wordware‚Äîan IDE for building AI agents. Today, we‚Äôre officially launching the Wordware platform, and we‚Äôre excited to show the world what we built.\\n\\nIt‚Äôs a tool (an IDE) that enables you to quickly build custom AI agents for specific use cases like legal contract generation, marketing content automation, invoice analysis, candidate screening, generating PRDs, and many more. We call applications built on Wordware ‚ÄòWordApps‚Äô because you can create them using natural language‚Äîin other words, using words (pun intended).\\n\\nOur core belief is that the domain expert‚Äînot the engineer‚Äîknows what good LLM output looks like. For example, lawyers building legal SaaS need to be deeply involved in the process, and working directly in the codebase or going back-and-forth with engineers isn‚Äôt the way to go.\\n\\nMost of our clients are cross-functional teams, including less technical members, who need to collaborate with engineers on LLM applications, such as assessing prompt outputs, and care about the speed of iterations. \\n\\nThese include early-stage startups building AI-first solutions that treat Wordware as their LLM backend, larger corporations that build 100s of prototypes on us, and AI builders creating their own products. From venture partners aiming to be in the top 0.1% of their field by building AI agents to analyze startups and founders, to lawyers scaling their expertise through AI, Wordware is the go-to tool.\\n\\nAnd if you‚Äôre technical, then you‚Äôll appreciate Wordware for the speed of building complex AI agents without messy LLM abstractions, as well as our advanced capabilities like loops, conditional logic (IF-Else), structured generation (JSON mode), and custom code execution, allowing you to connect to virtually any API.\\n\\nNote: you must not be afraid of no/low-code tools and simply accept it‚Äôs 10x faster than writing everything yourself‚Äînot to mention the annoying process of iterations on prompts in the codebase üòâ\\n\\nHere‚Äôs what you can do with Wordware - example use cases:\\n\\n‚úçüèª Custom content generation AI agent: Researches topics and writes SEO-optimized blog posts using online-enabled models and looping through table of contents. It helped created fully automated content execution for many teams.\\nüß† Invoice processing: Analyzes and processes unstructured invoices efficiently (up to 25k daily by one of our clients!), categorizing them and giving insights on financial data. Not only that, based on the data on the invoices it gives personalized recommendations on where to find cheaper alternatives based on geolocalization.\\nüìä Data querying and reporting: Performs data analysis through natural language commands, queries databases and constructs personalized reports. Users don‚Äôt have to be SQL fluent to get information, it can query big databases and save over 10h of work per week.\\nüìö Personalized learning and assessment agent: Prepares learning material personalized to the user‚Äôs level and needs by searching Wikipedia or research papers, then prepares quizzes and assesses user answers automatically.\\n‚ú® Sales enrichment: Searches LinkedIn and the web for information on leads, then updates and enriches your CRM with relevant data. Using different sources we can make sure the provided data is relevant and not hallucinated, making personalized outbound more effective.\\nüí¨ Meeting summaries: Provides personal voice summaries of all your weekly meetings in a structured manner. Not only that, it also categorizes them by meeting type so you never get lost in the notes.\\n\\nPS: Wordware is the platform behind Audioscribe (<a href=\"https://audioscribe.wordware.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://audioscribe.wordware.ai</a>) and Twitter Personality (<a href=\"https://twitter.wordware.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://twitter.wordware.ai</a>) projects, our open-source projects that we built to showcase the possibilities of Wordware.\\n\\nPS2: our Twitter Personality app gained 1 million users in the last 4 days - it‚Äôs a great showcase of what prompting and building an LLM backend on Wordware can achieve.', 'createdAt': '2024-07-26T06:04:15Z', 'votesCount': 46}, {'body': 'Hats off for launching such a remarkable product!', 'createdAt': '2024-08-15T09:29:22Z', 'votesCount': 2}, {'body': 'This product is amazing!

Allow me to introduce AgentQL, an AI-powered semantic framework designed to enable AI agents to seamlessly interact with the web, using natural language.\\n\\nThat\\'s a lot of big words. Let\\'s break down what AgentQL can do:\\n\\n üïπÔ∏è Give it the command to find \"price\", and it will retrieve all the price data on an e-commerce page you spend less time building rigid selectors\\n\\n üñ•Ô∏è Take the same code to another site, and it can work just as well &gt;&gt; you spend less time maintaining fragile scripts\\n\\n üìù. Need to interact with sites as part of your work flow? Simply use natural language, tell AgentQL to click, scroll_page or fill.\\n\\nSo why did we decide to build AgentQL?\\n\\nTraditional web automation struggles with identifying elements consistently through UI changes. When LLMs and agents first emerged, we envisioned a web infrastructure tailored for agentic interaction, which excels in handling these small but breaking changes, so we decided to tackle this challenge head-on.\\n\\nHow did we go about this?\\n\\nAt the heart of our framework is the AgentQL Query, a language crafted to describe locate web elements within a structured schema. We‚Äôve integrated robust DOM processing with advanced prompt engineering, creating a powerful combination that dynamically generates context-aware prompts. By doing so, we overcome the fragility of static XPath or attribute selector-based scripts, enabling a more resilient and flexible web interaction infrastructure.\\n\\nWould you like to join our journey to an agentic future?\\n\\nOur early users have reported real productivity boosts with AgentQL, unlocking use cases that were previously too costly or complex to develop.

For each project, we used a beta version of Helicone which gave us instant visibility into user engagement and result quality issues. As we talked to more builders and companies, we realized they were spending too much time building in-house solutions like this and that existing analytics products were not tailored for LLM workloads.\\n\\nüßä Helicone‚Äôs differentiators\\n\\nOther startups (LangChain) are working on similar products like LangSmith with high learning curves, rigid pricing structure and closed source, or are slow-moving giants like Datadog which isn‚Äôt exactly purpose-built for Large Language Models. \\n\\nüßä Our goals \\n\\nOur goal is simple. As a team of developers, we realized that we wanted a tool that ‚Äújust works‚Äù, and was dead easy to start. We focus a ton on the developer experience, by allowing developers to access all observability and monitoring features with just a header. We aim to help developers surface insights or errors, so they can focus on problem-solving faster. \\n\\nüßä What‚Äôs new with this launch\\n\\n‚≠ê Improved dashboard &amp; request table: we make it faster to segment your data on the dashboard, and view responses and relevant monitoring metrics such as cost, latency, and time to first token (TTFT). \\n\\n‚≠ê Introducing Sessions: trace your AI agent and RAG chatbot, debug them or refine your responses in different context in our Playground. \\n\\n‚≠ê Introducing Prompts &amp; Experiments: iterate on your prompts, experiment with a different dataset or model, and evaluate your responses with Scores. \\n\\n‚≠ê Scalability &amp; Reliability: since the beginning, we‚Äôve made significant progress towards 100% log coverage, so all your logs will be captured. \\n\\nThanks for supporting us on the launch!

You‚Äôre entirely on your own.  There‚Äôs no opportunity to meaningfully connect with, learn from, and be supported by other participants.\\n\\nSutra‚Äôs new Conversational Courses let you create rich, AI facilitated experiences that generate higher engagement, completion, and peer to peer exchange.\\n\\nAnd, it‚Äôs super easy to create a learning experience like this.\\n\\nOur Notion like editor lets your organize your content into sections divided by discussion prompts.  To unlock the next section, a participant has to respond to the prompt.  Our AI engine highlights the best responses, summarizes contributions, and finds connections between what people share.\\n\\n(Check out the interactive demo we posted to get the idea.)\\n\\nParticipants automatically get notifications that engage them in meaningful conversation.  \\n\\nIt‚Äôs like having a professional facilitator support your course to maximize participation and completion.\\n\\nSutra is super easy to set up and every participant in your learning experience makes it better.  As participants share their understanding and experience, it improves the overall body of knowledge that your course covers.  Our AI powered conversational engine makes sure the participants actually complete your experience, which in the long run also helps you make more money.\\n\\nThis is a total game changer and we‚Äôre super excited to be launching here on Product Hunt.\\n\\nThanks for your genuine feedback and support.\\n\\nWith love,\\n\\nLorenz', 'createdAt': '2024-08-12T16:14:06Z', 'votesCount': 47}, {'body': 'Good work @ghulam', 'createdAt': '2024-08-24T09:13:51Z', 'votesCount': 1}, {'body': \"It's great tool for course creator who recently started and experience as well\", 'createdAt': '2024-08-22T08:26:14Z', 'votesCount': 1}, {'body': \"Congrats on launching Sutra! üéâ Your innovative platform for creating engaging, AI-facilitated courses is a game-changer.

I led sales in both startups and spent 1000+ hours on cold outbound - emails, LinkedIn, and cold calling - I've done it all.

To our surprise, we didn't see a big difference in performance of AI-personalized emails and a templated one: Open rate was higher, but our customers weren't booking a lot more sales meetings.\\n\\nEventually we found the problem - Our users created lead lists with Apollo / ZoomInfo, based on filters like industry, size, and titles. Since no product can help everyone, 80-95% of people in the target list simply don't need their product at the time of outreach.\\n\\nEven with a perfect email, you can't sell a product to someone who doesn't need it. The realization led to the creation of Coldreach - AI for finding people who need you.\\n\\nü§î How does it work?\\n\\nPublic information about a company, like job descriptions, positions hired, news, 10k reports, tell A LOT about their internal priorities and problems they face.\\n\\nWe use AI to analyze them at scale, to find signals on who needs your help.\\n\\n‚úÖ Step 1: Tell us about your product - What problem it solves and who it is for\\n\\n‚úÖ Step 2: We suggest buying signals that indicate a need for your product\\n\\nExample signals\\n1.

I actually look forward to journaling. It allows me to open up to someone(thing) that doesn\\'t judge, and provides great advice.  My jaw often drops when it suggests or mentions something.  I even used it to help me make an Instagram/Facebook post description for a before and after picture post for my cleaning company. \\n\\nI don\\'t have a lot of friends, and I struggle to reach out. But this app has helped me by kinda being that \"friend\".\\n\\nIt also helps me build a to-do list, type thing.  They call it \"Ingredients\". I love the different approach. It parses my posts, and suggests what ingredients I should add. I\\'m not sure why, but it seems to be more effective for me then having to open a different task list and adding that, to which I usually end up forgetting what I was going to add. \\n\\nIt\\'s also caused me to be at the computer more, which has helped with my very major executive functioning issues, as part of my late in life neurodivergence diagnosis. I love that there is a mobile app now, but I plan to still do most of my journaling on the desktop. The Mobile App will be a nice companion when I am out and about though.\\n\\nI can brain dump with Rosebud. Get the ideas, good or bad, out of my head. This has been a HUGE stepping stone for me to finally figure out how to be productive, and go out and create, design, build, have hobbies and have projects.  This has helped me turn around mentally, and as a fantastic bi-product, possibly financially.  Owning a small business and living paycheque to paycheque (or less) is exhausting. This app helps me stay on-top of myself. It holds me accountable. Which in turn helps me find new love for what I do for work. Helping with my confidence to go out and sell services and clean my City. \\n\\nOnly thing I\\'d love is more integration into other services, like google tasks, gmail, google calendar, etc. But if I understand correctly, I believe that\\'s something very difficult for AI systems to do, privacy laws I\\'d imagine. \\n\\nThanks Rosebud!

So, instead of manually calculating all the myriad downstream impacts of a single meeting being scheduled, your calendar essentially optimizes itself around the clock.\\n\\nToday, we‚Äôre announcing what I believe is set to make an even bigger dent in solving the scheduling problem: Prism, a first-of-its-kind intelligent calendar.\\n\\nPrism lets you tap into the magic of Clockwise, unlocking a whole new way to manage your workday. Here are some of the highlights:\\n\\nü™Ñ Schedule the impossible - Powered by our scheduling engine‚Äôs capability to test millions of event arrangements across calendars, Prism makes it easy to find time on even the busiest of days. With just a few words or clicks, you can make way for urgent priorities unlike ever before.\\n\\n‚ùáÔ∏è Schedule at the best time, every time - Clockwise doesn‚Äôt just find open slots. It uncovers the best time to schedule anything from a 1:1 to a 10-person meeting‚Äîall based on our deep understanding of you and your colleague‚Äôs calendars and preferences.\\n\\n‚ö°Ô∏è Reschedule lightning-fast - Need to reschedule in a pinch? Sick kid at home or running late from an appointment? Head to Prism and simply ask to ‚Äúreschedule my afternoon‚Äù and we‚Äôll take care of the rest.\\n\\nüí¨ Bring the scheduling magic to Slack - Simply type your scheduling need (e.g. ‚ÄúBook 30 minutes with Jason tomorrow‚Äù) alongside the /cw slash command in Slack to use Clockwise to find time, right where your conversations are already happening.\\n\\n‚úÖ Never miss a to-do - Pop your to-do list into the Prism chat to convert tasks into flexible holds on your calendar.\\n\\nAnd so much more‚Ä¶\\n\\nAll this is made possible because Clockwise uses the powerful natural language processing capabilities of LLMs to translate your calendar request into its proprietary scheduling engine to understand exactly what you want when it comes to your calendar. \\n\\nMarried with Clockwise‚Äôs ability to analyze vast amounts of data across multiple calendars at once ‚Äì Prism is the most intelligent calendar that‚Äôs ever existed.', 'createdAt': '2024-08-22T03:16:03Z', 'votesCount': 19}, {'body': 'Loved your intro video.

Along with my brother Eric and our fantastic team of makers, I‚Äôm excited to introduce Aster Key‚Äîa groundbreaking app for lenders and privacy-conscious consumers. \\n\\n<strong>Today, we announce an industry first:</strong> \\nYou can start a mortgage process anonymously with mainstream lenders in the United States. \\n\\nOur previous start-up made waves with mobile apps and data solutions for the residential real estate industry. That company was acquired, and we founded Aster Key out of frustration with financial institutions‚Äô vulnerabilities to cyberattacks and data breaches. \\n\\nYes, our data has been hacked from lender databases! This was in the news this week: \"Massive data leak may include the personal data of every person in the US, UK, and Canada,\" so maybe you\\'ve experienced losing your data as well. \\n\\n<strong>The Problem</strong>\\n\\nWhen you apply for a mortgage, the harsh reality is that your data is treated like a hot potato‚Äîpassed between lenders, tech vendors, and intermediaries. This exposes your confidential information to numerous massive, centralized servers, making it a prime target for hackers.\\n\\n<strong>Our Solution</strong>\\n\\nüè¶ Aster Key provides a channel for mainstream lenders, enabling consumers to bypass the initial application process and start their loans anonymously.\\n\\nüí™ Empower Consumers: Our free and ultra-secure Aster Key app gives consumers control over their financial and personal data.\\n\\n<strong>Aster Key‚Äôs Security Features</strong>\\n\\nüîí Secure Storage: Financial data is encrypted and stored directly on the consumer\\'s mobile phone, never on our servers.\\nüîí Data Anonymization: Personally identifiable information is removed from financial data, which is then encrypted and stored separately.\\nüîí Automated Verification: Financial data is updated and verified via end-to-end encrypted integrations with Plaid and Argyle.\\nüîí Field-Level Encryption: We aim to encrypt each piece of financial data individually with changing keys, not just at the database level.\\n\\n<strong>Key Features for Consumers</strong>\\n\\nüîí Centralized view of all financial information for lifetime use.\\nüîí Dynamically generated personal financial statements and proof of funds.\\nüîí Single passphrase and biometric authentication for enhanced security.\\nüîí Anonymous Communication: Protects email address when contacting lenders.\\nüîí A private, ad-free environment.\\nüöÄ Anonymous mortgage initiation.\\n\\nAdditionally, the app allows you to create verified financial statements and self-serve automated proof of funds letters in the U.S. and several supported countries. We‚Äôre planning global expansion, so feel free to reach out if you‚Äôre interested in collaborating.\\n\\nUnlike other finance apps like NerdWallet or Credit Karma, Aster Key prioritizes data privacy and ownership, not marketing your data. We\\'re embracing defi principles and have an on-chain, Web3 roadmap.  Today, we turn your mobile phone into a decentralized node, a mainstream on-ramp to the future.\\n\\nAs <strong>Product Hunters</strong>, you‚Äôre likely the tech-savvy person in your circle‚Äîwhether at work or in your personal life. Together, we can protect people‚Äôs financial assets, and we‚Äôd love your feedback and support. ‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you.', 'createdAt': '2024-08-03T14:03:49Z', 'votesCount': 22}, {'body': 'Such a relevant problem to tackle in the mortgage space.

We know that selling ads and sponsorships is complex‚Äîevery medium (podcasts, billboards, newsletters, and more) has different pricing structures and booking dynamics. That‚Äôs why we specifically built a ‚ÄúShopify for selling ads and sponsorships‚Äù to provide tools like building an online store, creating publicly available listings and proposals, collecting leads, and managing checkout. Anyone can create direct, private marketplace deals for various types of ad inventory, from billboard ads to sponsorships, and everything in between.\\n\\nOur product pipeline includes offering a set of smart features we currently provide to specific customers, which will soon be available to all users. These features include interactive mapping, a digital deal room, and a more comprehensive admin panel.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nA New Direction for Fucimo\\n\\nOur journey began with a bold vision, but as with many startups, our path has evolved. What started as an ambitious marketplace has transformed into something even more powerful‚Äîa platform that empowers sellers with the tools they need to succeed in a complex advertising landscape.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nWhere We Started\\n\\nIn our first year, we set out to become ‚ÄúThe Amazon of Advertising.‚Äù Our goal was to connect hundreds of small and medium-sized networks, both analog and digital, to a demand-side platform that would enable the long-tail of publishers to sell more, faster, and with less operational burden. It was a bold vision, and we were excited to see where it could take us.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nWhat We Learned\\n\\nAlong the way, we onboarded some incredible media companies, from digital billboards to taxi tops and even CGI-generated ‚ÄúFake OOH.‚Äù Our marketplace impressed hundreds of marketers and companies at SXSW earlier this year, who loved seeing such a variety of cool things in one place.\\n\\nHowever, after meeting with hundreds of agencies, advertisers, and media companies, we realized that changing an entire industry‚Äôs buying behavior is a daunting task. While the excitement was palpable, the feedback was clear: there was a different path that held even greater potential. When everyone is saying, ‚ÄúHow can I use this feature you have built for yourself for me?‚Äù‚Äîyou have to listen.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nWhere We‚Äôre Going\\n\\nJust as Shopify has built the e-commerce infrastructure to empower anyone to become an entrepreneur, we want to do the same in an era where all companies are now becoming advertising companies.\\n\\nOur ambition is to build Fucimo to offer anyone, regardless of their size (creators, companies, freelancers, etc.), a seat at the table where they can build their own ad network or storefront using the features we‚Äôve specifically developed for selling and buying ads. Fucimo will continue to enable sellers, but now with a sharper focus on providing the tools needed to streamline and enhance ad sales. Whether you‚Äôre selling out-of-home ads, sponsorships, or other types of ad inventory, Fucimo is here to make your life easier and your business more profitable.\\n\\nIf you have ad space to sell and want to move beyond static media kits, Fucimo may be just what you need.', 'createdAt': '2024-08-09T06:42:57Z', 'votesCount': 17}, {'body': 'This is a fantastic idea, and I love how its made to be so user friendly.

Think classification, regression, ranking, and recommendation systems. With over 20 million downloads, we\\'re now bringing our toolset to help evaluate and test LLM-powered products.\\n\\nAs you build an LLM-powered app or feature, figuring out if it\\'s \"good enough\" can be tricky. Evaluating generative AI is different from traditional software and predictive ML. It lacks clear criteria and labeled answers, making quality more subjective and harder to measure. But there is no way around it: to deploy an AI app to production, you need a way to evaluate it.\\n\\nFor instance, you might ask:\\n- How does the quality compare if I switch from GPT to Claude?\\n- What will change if I tweak a prompt? Do my previous good answers hold?\\n- Where is it failing?\\n- What real-world quality are users experiencing?\\n\\nIt\\'s not just about metrics‚Äîit\\'s about the whole quality workflow. You need to define what \"good\" means for your app, set up offline tests, and monitor live quality. \\n\\nWith Evidently, we provide the complete open-source infrastructure to build and manage these evaluation workflows.

It takes away from the core development process.\\n\\nIs there a better way?\\n\\nYes, there is Exopods! It offers a simpler, more efficient solution for everyone, from novice developers to seasoned professionals using the below features:\\n\\n- Effortless Deployment: Deploy your apps directly from GitHub with just a few clicks. No complex configurations or technical knowledge is required.\\n- Customizable Endpoints: Easily create and manage custom endpoints for your services.\\n- Secure and Scalable: Benefit from free SSL-secured domains and flexible pay-as-you-go pricing that scales with your needs.\\n- Team Collaboration: Onboard your team members for seamless collaboration and management of services.\\n- Automated Deployments: Automate your deployment process with GitHub integration, saving time and effort.\\n- Comprehensive Dashboard: Manage your projects, teams, builds, and payments through our user-friendly dashboard.\\n\\nHow to get started?\\n\\nFor our PH community, Exopods is risk-free with our free trial with $5 as a Bonus ‚Äì this is not something we have offered publicly before.\\n\\nIf you decide to join us on this journey as a paying customer, we have made the pricing model much easier by giving users a pay-as-you-go option to only pay for their utilization.\\n\\nThank you so much.

Today, we‚Äôre officially launching the Wordware platform, and we‚Äôre excited to show the world what we built.\\n\\nIt‚Äôs a tool (an IDE) that enables you to quickly build custom AI agents for specific use cases like legal contract generation, marketing content automation, invoice analysis, candidate screening, generating PRDs, and many more. We call applications built on Wordware ‚ÄòWordApps‚Äô because you can create them using natural language‚Äîin other words, using words (pun intended).\\n\\nOur core belief is that the domain expert‚Äînot the engineer‚Äîknows what good LLM output looks like. For example, lawyers building legal SaaS need to be deeply involved in the process, and working directly in the codebase or going back-and-forth with engineers isn‚Äôt the way to go.\\n\\nMost of our clients are cross-functional teams, including less technical members, who need to collaborate with engineers on LLM applications, such as assessing prompt outputs, and care about the speed of iterations. \\n\\nThese include early-stage startups building AI-first solutions that treat Wordware as their LLM backend, larger corporations that build 100s of prototypes on us, and AI builders creating their own products. From venture partners aiming to be in the top 0.1% of their field by building AI agents to analyze startups and founders, to lawyers scaling their expertise through AI, Wordware is the go-to tool.\\n\\nAnd if you‚Äôre technical, then you‚Äôll appreciate Wordware for the speed of building complex AI agents without messy LLM abstractions, as well as our advanced capabilities like loops, conditional logic (IF-Else), structured generation (JSON mode), and custom code execution, allowing you to connect to virtually any API.\\n\\nNote: you must not be afraid of no/low-code tools and simply accept it‚Äôs 10x faster than writing everything yourself‚Äînot to mention the annoying process of iterations on prompts in the codebase üòâ\\n\\nHere‚Äôs what you can do with Wordware - example use cases:\\n\\n‚úçüèª Custom content generation AI agent: Researches topics and writes SEO-optimized blog posts using online-enabled models and looping through table of contents. It helped created fully automated content execution for many teams.\\nüß† Invoice processing: Analyzes and processes unstructured invoices efficiently (up to 25k daily by one of our clients!), categorizing them and giving insights on financial data. Not only that, based on the data on the invoices it gives personalized recommendations on where to find cheaper alternatives based on geolocalization.\\nüìä Data querying and reporting: Performs data analysis through natural language commands, queries databases and constructs personalized reports. Users don‚Äôt have to be SQL fluent to get information, it can query big databases and save over 10h of work per week.\\nüìö Personalized learning and assessment agent: Prepares learning material personalized to the user‚Äôs level and needs by searching Wikipedia or research papers, then prepares quizzes and assesses user answers automatically.\\n‚ú® Sales enrichment: Searches LinkedIn and the web for information on leads, then updates and enriches your CRM with relevant data. Using different sources we can make sure the provided data is relevant and not hallucinated, making personalized outbound more effective.\\nüí¨ Meeting summaries: Provides personal voice summaries of all your weekly meetings in a structured manner. Not only that, it also categorizes them by meeting type so you never get lost in the notes.\\n\\nPS: Wordware is the platform behind Audioscribe (<a href=\"https://audioscribe.wordware.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://audioscribe.wordware.ai</a>) and Twitter Personality (<a href=\"https://twitter.wordware.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://twitter.wordware.ai</a>) projects, our open-source projects that we built to showcase the possibilities of Wordware.\\n\\nPS2: our Twitter Personality app gained 1 million users in the last 4 days - it‚Äôs a great showcase of what prompting and building an LLM backend on Wordware can achieve.',\n",

We call applications built on Wordware ‚ÄòWordApps‚Äô because you can create them using natural language‚Äîin other words, using words (pun intended).\\n\\nOur core belief is that the domain expert‚Äînot the engineer‚Äîknows what good LLM output looks like. For example, lawyers building legal SaaS need to be deeply involved in the process, and working directly in the codebase or going back-and-forth with engineers isn‚Äôt the way to go.\\n\\nMost of our clients are cross-functional teams, including less technical members, who need to collaborate with engineers on LLM applications, such as assessing prompt outputs, and care about the speed of iterations. \\n\\nThese include early-stage startups building AI-first solutions that treat Wordware as their LLM backend, larger corporations that build 100s of prototypes on us, and AI builders creating their own products. From venture partners aiming to be in the top 0.1% of their field by building AI agents to analyze startups and founders, to lawyers scaling their expertise through AI, Wordware is the go-to tool.\\n\\nAnd if you‚Äôre technical, then you‚Äôll appreciate Wordware for the speed of building complex AI agents without messy LLM abstractions, as well as our advanced capabilities like loops, conditional logic (IF-Else), structured generation (JSON mode), and custom code execution, allowing you to connect to virtually any API.\\n\\nNote: you must not be afraid of no/low-code tools and simply accept it‚Äôs 10x faster than writing everything yourself‚Äînot to mention the annoying process of iterations on prompts in the codebase üòâ\\n\\nHere‚Äôs what you can do with Wordware - example use cases:\\n\\n‚úçüèª Custom content generation AI agent: Researches topics and writes SEO-optimized blog posts using online-enabled models and looping through table of contents.

Not only that, based on the data on the invoices it gives personalized recommendations on where to find cheaper alternatives based on geolocalization.\\nüìä Data querying and reporting: Performs data analysis through natural language commands, queries databases and constructs personalized reports.

Today, we‚Äôre officially launching the Wordware platform, and we‚Äôre excited to show the world what we built.\\n\\nIt‚Äôs a tool (an IDE) that enables you to quickly build custom AI agents for specific use cases like legal contract generation, marketing content automation, invoice analysis, candidate screening, generating PRDs, and many more. We call applications built on Wordware ‚ÄòWordApps‚Äô because you can create them using natural language‚Äîin other words, using words (pun intended).\\n\\nOur core belief is that the domain expert‚Äînot the engineer‚Äîknows what good LLM output looks like. For example, lawyers building legal SaaS need to be deeply involved in the process, and working directly in the codebase or going back-and-forth with engineers isn‚Äôt the way to go.\\n\\nMost of our clients are cross-functional teams, including less technical members, who need to collaborate with engineers on LLM applications, such as assessing prompt outputs, and care about the speed of iterations. \\n\\nThese include early-stage startups building AI-first solutions that treat Wordware as their LLM backend, larger corporations that build 100s of prototypes on us, and AI builders creating their own products. From venture partners aiming to be in the top 0.1% of their field by building AI agents to analyze startups and founders, to lawyers scaling their expertise through AI, Wordware is the go-to tool.\\n\\nAnd if you‚Äôre technical, then you‚Äôll appreciate Wordware for the speed of building complex AI agents without messy LLM abstractions, as well as our advanced capabilities like loops, conditional logic (IF-Else), structured generation (JSON mode), and custom code execution, allowing you to connect to virtually any API.\\n\\nNote: you must not be afraid of no/low-code tools and simply accept it‚Äôs 10x faster than writing everything yourself‚Äînot to mention the annoying process of iterations on prompts in the codebase üòâ\\n\\nHere‚Äôs what you can do with Wordware - example use cases:\\n\\n‚úçüèª Custom content generation AI agent: Researches topics and writes SEO-optimized blog posts using online-enabled models and looping through table of contents. It helped created fully automated content execution for many teams.\\nüß† Invoice processing: Analyzes and processes unstructured invoices efficiently (up to 25k daily by one of our clients!), categorizing them and giving insights on financial data. Not only that, based on the data on the invoices it gives personalized recommendations on where to find cheaper alternatives based on geolocalization.\\nüìä Data querying and reporting: Performs data analysis through natural language commands, queries databases and constructs personalized reports. Users don‚Äôt have to be SQL fluent to get information, it can query big databases and save over 10h of work per week.\\nüìö Personalized learning and assessment agent: Prepares learning material personalized to the user‚Äôs level and needs by searching Wikipedia or research papers, then prepares quizzes and assesses user answers automatically.\\n‚ú® Sales enrichment: Searches LinkedIn and the web for information on leads, then updates and enriches your CRM with relevant data. Using different sources we can make sure the provided data is relevant and not hallucinated, making personalized outbound more effective.\\nüí¨ Meeting summaries: Provides personal voice summaries of all your weekly meetings in a structured manner. Not only that, it also categorizes them by meeting type so you never get lost in the notes.\\n\\nPS: Wordware is the platform behind Audioscribe (<a href=\"https://audioscribe.wordware.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://audioscribe.wordware.ai</a>) and Twitter Personality (<a href=\"https://twitter.wordware.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://twitter.wordware.ai</a>) projects, our open-source projects that we built to showcase the possibilities of Wordware.\\n\\nPS2: our Twitter Personality app gained 1 million users in the last 4 days - it‚Äôs a great showcase of what prompting and building an LLM backend on Wordware can achieve.', 'createdAt': '2024-07-26T06:04:15Z', 'votesCount': 46}, {'body': 'Hats off for launching such a remarkable product!', 'createdAt': '2024-08-15T09:29:22Z', 'votesCount': 2}, {'body': 'This product is amazing!

Allow me to introduce AgentQL, an AI-powered semantic framework designed to enable AI agents to seamlessly interact with the web, using natural language.\\n\\nThat\\'s a lot of big words. Let\\'s break down what AgentQL can do:\\n\\n üïπÔ∏è Give it the command to find \"price\", and it will retrieve all the price data on an e-commerce page you spend less time building rigid selectors\\n\\n üñ•Ô∏è Take the same code to another site, and it can work just as well &gt;&gt; you spend less time maintaining fragile scripts\\n\\n üìù. Need to interact with sites as part of your work flow? Simply use natural language, tell AgentQL to click, scroll_page or fill.\\n\\nSo why did we decide to build AgentQL?\\n\\nTraditional web automation struggles with identifying elements consistently through UI changes. When LLMs and agents first emerged, we envisioned a web infrastructure tailored for agentic interaction, which excels in handling these small but breaking changes, so we decided to tackle this challenge head-on.\\n\\nHow did we go about this?\\n\\nAt the heart of our framework is the AgentQL Query, a language crafted to describe locate web elements within a structured schema. We‚Äôve integrated robust DOM processing with advanced prompt engineering, creating a powerful combination that dynamically generates context-aware prompts. By doing so, we overcome the fragility of static XPath or attribute selector-based scripts, enabling a more resilient and flexible web interaction infrastructure.\\n\\nWould you like to join our journey to an agentic future?\\n\\nOur early users have reported real productivity boosts with AgentQL, unlocking use cases that were previously too costly or complex to develop.

For each project, we used a beta version of Helicone which gave us instant visibility into user engagement and result quality issues. As we talked to more builders and companies, we realized they were spending too much time building in-house solutions like this and that existing analytics products were not tailored for LLM workloads.\\n\\nüßä Helicone‚Äôs differentiators\\n\\nOther startups (LangChain) are working on similar products like LangSmith with high learning curves, rigid pricing structure and closed source, or are slow-moving giants like Datadog which isn‚Äôt exactly purpose-built for Large Language Models. \\n\\nüßä Our goals \\n\\nOur goal is simple. As a team of developers, we realized that we wanted a tool that ‚Äújust works‚Äù, and was dead easy to start. We focus a ton on the developer experience, by allowing developers to access all observability and monitoring features with just a header. We aim to help developers surface insights or errors, so they can focus on problem-solving faster. \\n\\nüßä What‚Äôs new with this launch\\n\\n‚≠ê Improved dashboard &amp; request table: we make it faster to segment your data on the dashboard, and view responses and relevant monitoring metrics such as cost, latency, and time to first token (TTFT). \\n\\n‚≠ê Introducing Sessions: trace your AI agent and RAG chatbot, debug them or refine your responses in different context in our Playground. \\n\\n‚≠ê Introducing Prompts &amp; Experiments: iterate on your prompts, experiment with a different dataset or model, and evaluate your responses with Scores. \\n\\n‚≠ê Scalability &amp; Reliability: since the beginning, we‚Äôve made significant progress towards 100% log coverage, so all your logs will be captured. \\n\\nThanks for supporting us on the launch!

You‚Äôre entirely on your own.  There‚Äôs no opportunity to meaningfully connect with, learn from, and be supported by other participants.\\n\\nSutra‚Äôs new Conversational Courses let you create rich, AI facilitated experiences that generate higher engagement, completion, and peer to peer exchange.\\n\\nAnd, it‚Äôs super easy to create a learning experience like this.\\n\\nOur Notion like editor lets your organize your content into sections divided by discussion prompts.  To unlock the next section, a participant has to respond to the prompt.  Our AI engine highlights the best responses, summarizes contributions, and finds connections between what people share.\\n\\n(Check out the interactive demo we posted to get the idea.)\\n\\nParticipants automatically get notifications that engage them in meaningful conversation.  \\n\\nIt‚Äôs like having a professional facilitator support your course to maximize participation and completion.\\n\\nSutra is super easy to set up and every participant in your learning experience makes it better.  As participants share their understanding and experience, it improves the overall body of knowledge that your course covers.  Our AI powered conversational engine makes sure the participants actually complete your experience, which in the long run also helps you make more money.\\n\\nThis is a total game changer and we‚Äôre super excited to be launching here on Product Hunt.\\n\\nThanks for your genuine feedback and support.\\n\\nWith love,\\n\\nLorenz', 'createdAt': '2024-08-12T16:14:06Z', 'votesCount': 47}, {'body': 'Good work @ghulam', 'createdAt': '2024-08-24T09:13:51Z', 'votesCount': 1}, {'body': \"It's great tool for course creator who recently started and experience as well\", 'createdAt': '2024-08-22T08:26:14Z', 'votesCount': 1}, {'body': \"Congrats on launching Sutra! üéâ Your innovative platform for creating engaging, AI-facilitated courses is a game-changer.

I led sales in both startups and spent 1000+ hours on cold outbound - emails, LinkedIn, and cold calling - I've done it all.

To our surprise, we didn't see a big difference in performance of AI-personalized emails and a templated one: Open rate was higher, but our customers weren't booking a lot more sales meetings.\\n\\nEventually we found the problem - Our users created lead lists with Apollo / ZoomInfo, based on filters like industry, size, and titles. Since no product can help everyone, 80-95% of people in the target list simply don't need their product at the time of outreach.\\n\\nEven with a perfect email, you can't sell a product to someone who doesn't need it. The realization led to the creation of Coldreach - AI for finding people who need you.\\n\\nü§î How does it work?\\n\\nPublic information about a company, like job descriptions, positions hired, news, 10k reports, tell A LOT about their internal priorities and problems they face.\\n\\nWe use AI to analyze them at scale, to find signals on who needs your help.\\n\\n‚úÖ Step 1: Tell us about your product - What problem it solves and who it is for\\n\\n‚úÖ Step 2: We suggest buying signals that indicate a need for your product\\n\\nExample signals\\n1.

I actually look forward to journaling. It allows me to open up to someone(thing) that doesn\\'t judge, and provides great advice.  My jaw often drops when it suggests or mentions something.  I even used it to help me make an Instagram/Facebook post description for a before and after picture post for my cleaning company. \\n\\nI don\\'t have a lot of friends, and I struggle to reach out. But this app has helped me by kinda being that \"friend\".\\n\\nIt also helps me build a to-do list, type thing.  They call it \"Ingredients\". I love the different approach. It parses my posts, and suggests what ingredients I should add. I\\'m not sure why, but it seems to be more effective for me then having to open a different task list and adding that, to which I usually end up forgetting what I was going to add. \\n\\nIt\\'s also caused me to be at the computer more, which has helped with my very major executive functioning issues, as part of my late in life neurodivergence diagnosis. I love that there is a mobile app now, but I plan to still do most of my journaling on the desktop. The Mobile App will be a nice companion when I am out and about though.\\n\\nI can brain dump with Rosebud. Get the ideas, good or bad, out of my head. This has been a HUGE stepping stone for me to finally figure out how to be productive, and go out and create, design, build, have hobbies and have projects.  This has helped me turn around mentally, and as a fantastic bi-product, possibly financially.  Owning a small business and living paycheque to paycheque (or less) is exhausting. This app helps me stay on-top of myself. It holds me accountable. Which in turn helps me find new love for what I do for work. Helping with my confidence to go out and sell services and clean my City. \\n\\nOnly thing I\\'d love is more integration into other services, like google tasks, gmail, google calendar, etc. But if I understand correctly, I believe that\\'s something very difficult for AI systems to do, privacy laws I\\'d imagine. \\n\\nThanks Rosebud!

So, instead of manually calculating all the myriad downstream impacts of a single meeting being scheduled, your calendar essentially optimizes itself around the clock.\\n\\nToday, we‚Äôre announcing what I believe is set to make an even bigger dent in solving the scheduling problem: Prism, a first-of-its-kind intelligent calendar.\\n\\nPrism lets you tap into the magic of Clockwise, unlocking a whole new way to manage your workday. Here are some of the highlights:\\n\\nü™Ñ Schedule the impossible - Powered by our scheduling engine‚Äôs capability to test millions of event arrangements across calendars, Prism makes it easy to find time on even the busiest of days. With just a few words or clicks, you can make way for urgent priorities unlike ever before.\\n\\n‚ùáÔ∏è Schedule at the best time, every time - Clockwise doesn‚Äôt just find open slots. It uncovers the best time to schedule anything from a 1:1 to a 10-person meeting‚Äîall based on our deep understanding of you and your colleague‚Äôs calendars and preferences.\\n\\n‚ö°Ô∏è Reschedule lightning-fast - Need to reschedule in a pinch? Sick kid at home or running late from an appointment? Head to Prism and simply ask to ‚Äúreschedule my afternoon‚Äù and we‚Äôll take care of the rest.\\n\\nüí¨ Bring the scheduling magic to Slack - Simply type your scheduling need (e.g. ‚ÄúBook 30 minutes with Jason tomorrow‚Äù) alongside the /cw slash command in Slack to use Clockwise to find time, right where your conversations are already happening.\\n\\n‚úÖ Never miss a to-do - Pop your to-do list into the Prism chat to convert tasks into flexible holds on your calendar.\\n\\nAnd so much more‚Ä¶\\n\\nAll this is made possible because Clockwise uses the powerful natural language processing capabilities of LLMs to translate your calendar request into its proprietary scheduling engine to understand exactly what you want when it comes to your calendar. \\n\\nMarried with Clockwise‚Äôs ability to analyze vast amounts of data across multiple calendars at once ‚Äì Prism is the most intelligent calendar that‚Äôs ever existed.', 'createdAt': '2024-08-22T03:16:03Z', 'votesCount': 19}, {'body': 'Loved your intro video.

Along with my brother Eric and our fantastic team of makers, I‚Äôm excited to introduce Aster Key‚Äîa groundbreaking app for lenders and privacy-conscious consumers. \\n\\n<strong>Today, we announce an industry first:</strong> \\nYou can start a mortgage process anonymously with mainstream lenders in the United States. \\n\\nOur previous start-up made waves with mobile apps and data solutions for the residential real estate industry. That company was acquired, and we founded Aster Key out of frustration with financial institutions‚Äô vulnerabilities to cyberattacks and data breaches. \\n\\nYes, our data has been hacked from lender databases! This was in the news this week: \"Massive data leak may include the personal data of every person in the US, UK, and Canada,\" so maybe you\\'ve experienced losing your data as well. \\n\\n<strong>The Problem</strong>\\n\\nWhen you apply for a mortgage, the harsh reality is that your data is treated like a hot potato‚Äîpassed between lenders, tech vendors, and intermediaries. This exposes your confidential information to numerous massive, centralized servers, making it a prime target for hackers.\\n\\n<strong>Our Solution</strong>\\n\\nüè¶ Aster Key provides a channel for mainstream lenders, enabling consumers to bypass the initial application process and start their loans anonymously.\\n\\nüí™ Empower Consumers: Our free and ultra-secure Aster Key app gives consumers control over their financial and personal data.\\n\\n<strong>Aster Key‚Äôs Security Features</strong>\\n\\nüîí Secure Storage: Financial data is encrypted and stored directly on the consumer\\'s mobile phone, never on our servers.\\nüîí Data Anonymization: Personally identifiable information is removed from financial data, which is then encrypted and stored separately.\\nüîí Automated Verification: Financial data is updated and verified via end-to-end encrypted integrations with Plaid and Argyle.\\nüîí Field-Level Encryption: We aim to encrypt each piece of financial data individually with changing keys, not just at the database level.\\n\\n<strong>Key Features for Consumers</strong>\\n\\nüîí Centralized view of all financial information for lifetime use.\\nüîí Dynamically generated personal financial statements and proof of funds.\\nüîí Single passphrase and biometric authentication for enhanced security.\\nüîí Anonymous Communication: Protects email address when contacting lenders.\\nüîí A private, ad-free environment.\\nüöÄ Anonymous mortgage initiation.\\n\\nAdditionally, the app allows you to create verified financial statements and self-serve automated proof of funds letters in the U.S. and several supported countries. We‚Äôre planning global expansion, so feel free to reach out if you‚Äôre interested in collaborating.\\n\\nUnlike other finance apps like NerdWallet or Credit Karma, Aster Key prioritizes data privacy and ownership, not marketing your data. We\\'re embracing defi principles and have an on-chain, Web3 roadmap.  Today, we turn your mobile phone into a decentralized node, a mainstream on-ramp to the future.\\n\\nAs <strong>Product Hunters</strong>, you‚Äôre likely the tech-savvy person in your circle‚Äîwhether at work or in your personal life. Together, we can protect people‚Äôs financial assets, and we‚Äôd love your feedback and support. ‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you.', 'createdAt': '2024-08-03T14:03:49Z', 'votesCount': 22}, {'body': 'Such a relevant problem to tackle in the mortgage space.

We know that selling ads and sponsorships is complex‚Äîevery medium (podcasts, billboards, newsletters, and more) has different pricing structures and booking dynamics. That‚Äôs why we specifically built a ‚ÄúShopify for selling ads and sponsorships‚Äù to provide tools like building an online store, creating publicly available listings and proposals, collecting leads, and managing checkout. Anyone can create direct, private marketplace deals for various types of ad inventory, from billboard ads to sponsorships, and everything in between.\\n\\nOur product pipeline includes offering a set of smart features we currently provide to specific customers, which will soon be available to all users. These features include interactive mapping, a digital deal room, and a more comprehensive admin panel.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nA New Direction for Fucimo\\n\\nOur journey began with a bold vision, but as with many startups, our path has evolved. What started as an ambitious marketplace has transformed into something even more powerful‚Äîa platform that empowers sellers with the tools they need to succeed in a complex advertising landscape.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nWhere We Started\\n\\nIn our first year, we set out to become ‚ÄúThe Amazon of Advertising.‚Äù Our goal was to connect hundreds of small and medium-sized networks, both analog and digital, to a demand-side platform that would enable the long-tail of publishers to sell more, faster, and with less operational burden. It was a bold vision, and we were excited to see where it could take us.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nWhat We Learned\\n\\nAlong the way, we onboarded some incredible media companies, from digital billboards to taxi tops and even CGI-generated ‚ÄúFake OOH.‚Äù Our marketplace impressed hundreds of marketers and companies at SXSW earlier this year, who loved seeing such a variety of cool things in one place.\\n\\nHowever, after meeting with hundreds of agencies, advertisers, and media companies, we realized that changing an entire industry‚Äôs buying behavior is a daunting task. While the excitement was palpable, the feedback was clear: there was a different path that held even greater potential. When everyone is saying, ‚ÄúHow can I use this feature you have built for yourself for me?‚Äù‚Äîyou have to listen.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nWhere We‚Äôre Going\\n\\nJust as Shopify has built the e-commerce infrastructure to empower anyone to become an entrepreneur, we want to do the same in an era where all companies are now becoming advertising companies.\\n\\nOur ambition is to build Fucimo to offer anyone, regardless of their size (creators, companies, freelancers, etc.), a seat at the table where they can build their own ad network or storefront using the features we‚Äôve specifically developed for selling and buying ads. Fucimo will continue to enable sellers, but now with a sharper focus on providing the tools needed to streamline and enhance ad sales. Whether you‚Äôre selling out-of-home ads, sponsorships, or other types of ad inventory, Fucimo is here to make your life easier and your business more profitable.\\n\\nIf you have ad space to sell and want to move beyond static media kits, Fucimo may be just what you need.', 'createdAt': '2024-08-09T06:42:57Z', 'votesCount': 17}, {'body': 'This is a fantastic idea, and I love how its made to be so user friendly.

Think classification, regression, ranking, and recommendation systems. With over 20 million downloads, we\\'re now bringing our toolset to help evaluate and test LLM-powered products.\\n\\nAs you build an LLM-powered app or feature, figuring out if it\\'s \"good enough\" can be tricky. Evaluating generative AI is different from traditional software and predictive ML. It lacks clear criteria and labeled answers, making quality more subjective and harder to measure. But there is no way around it: to deploy an AI app to production, you need a way to evaluate it.\\n\\nFor instance, you might ask:\\n- How does the quality compare if I switch from GPT to Claude?\\n- What will change if I tweak a prompt? Do my previous good answers hold?\\n- Where is it failing?\\n- What real-world quality are users experiencing?\\n\\nIt\\'s not just about metrics‚Äîit\\'s about the whole quality workflow. You need to define what \"good\" means for your app, set up offline tests, and monitor live quality. \\n\\nWith Evidently, we provide the complete open-source infrastructure to build and manage these evaluation workflows.

It takes away from the core development process.\\n\\nIs there a better way?\\n\\nYes, there is Exopods! It offers a simpler, more efficient solution for everyone, from novice developers to seasoned professionals using the below features:\\n\\n- Effortless Deployment: Deploy your apps directly from GitHub with just a few clicks. No complex configurations or technical knowledge is required.\\n- Customizable Endpoints: Easily create and manage custom endpoints for your services.\\n- Secure and Scalable: Benefit from free SSL-secured domains and flexible pay-as-you-go pricing that scales with your needs.\\n- Team Collaboration: Onboard your team members for seamless collaboration and management of services.\\n- Automated Deployments: Automate your deployment process with GitHub integration, saving time and effort.\\n- Comprehensive Dashboard: Manage your projects, teams, builds, and payments through our user-friendly dashboard.\\n\\nHow to get started?\\n\\nFor our PH community, Exopods is risk-free with our free trial with $5 as a Bonus ‚Äì this is not something we have offered publicly before.\\n\\nIf you decide to join us on this journey as a paying customer, we have made the pricing model much easier by giving users a pay-as-you-go option to only pay for their utilization.\\n\\nThank you so much.

Today, we‚Äôre officially launching the Wordware platform, and we‚Äôre excited to show the world what we built.\\n\\nIt‚Äôs a tool (an IDE) that enables you to quickly build custom AI agents for specific use cases like legal contract generation, marketing content automation, invoice analysis, candidate screening, generating PRDs, and many more. We call applications built on Wordware ‚ÄòWordApps‚Äô because you can create them using natural language‚Äîin other words, using words (pun intended).\\n\\nOur core belief is that the domain expert‚Äînot the engineer‚Äîknows what good LLM output looks like. For example, lawyers building legal SaaS need to be deeply involved in the process, and working directly in the codebase or going back-and-forth with engineers isn‚Äôt the way to go.\\n\\nMost of our clients are cross-functional teams, including less technical members, who need to collaborate with engineers on LLM applications, such as assessing prompt outputs, and care about the speed of iterations. \\n\\nThese include early-stage startups building AI-first solutions that treat Wordware as their LLM backend, larger corporations that build 100s of prototypes on us, and AI builders creating their own products. From venture partners aiming to be in the top 0.1% of their field by building AI agents to analyze startups and founders, to lawyers scaling their expertise through AI, Wordware is the go-to tool.\\n\\nAnd if you‚Äôre technical, then you‚Äôll appreciate Wordware for the speed of building complex AI agents without messy LLM abstractions, as well as our advanced capabilities like loops, conditional logic (IF-Else), structured generation (JSON mode), and custom code execution, allowing you to connect to virtually any API.\\n\\nNote: you must not be afraid of no/low-code tools and simply accept it‚Äôs 10x faster than writing everything yourself‚Äînot to mention the annoying process of iterations on prompts in the codebase üòâ\\n\\nHere‚Äôs what you can do with Wordware - example use cases:\\n\\n‚úçüèª Custom content generation AI agent: Researches topics and writes SEO-optimized blog posts using online-enabled models and looping through table of contents. It helped created fully automated content execution for many teams.\\nüß† Invoice processing: Analyzes and processes unstructured invoices efficiently (up to 25k daily by one of our clients!), categorizing them and giving insights on financial data. Not only that, based on the data on the invoices it gives personalized recommendations on where to find cheaper alternatives based on geolocalization.\\nüìä Data querying and reporting: Performs data analysis through natural language commands, queries databases and constructs personalized reports. Users don‚Äôt have to be SQL fluent to get information, it can query big databases and save over 10h of work per week.\\nüìö Personalized learning and assessment agent: Prepares learning material personalized to the user‚Äôs level and needs by searching Wikipedia or research papers, then prepares quizzes and assesses user answers automatically.\\n‚ú® Sales enrichment: Searches LinkedIn and the web for information on leads, then updates and enriches your CRM with relevant data. Using different sources we can make sure the provided data is relevant and not hallucinated, making personalized outbound more effective.\\nüí¨ Meeting summaries: Provides personal voice summaries of all your weekly meetings in a structured manner. Not only that, it also categorizes them by meeting type so you never get lost in the notes.\\n\\nPS: Wordware is the platform behind Audioscribe (<a href=\"https://audioscribe.wordware.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://audioscribe.wordware.ai</a>) and Twitter Personality (<a href=\"https://twitter.wordware.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://twitter.wordware.ai</a>) projects, our open-source projects that we built to showcase the possibilities of Wordware.\\n\\nPS2: our Twitter Personality app gained 1 million users in the last 4 days - it‚Äôs a great showcase of what prompting and building an LLM backend on Wordware can achieve.', 'createdAt': '2024-07-26T06:04:15Z', 'votesCount': 46}, {'body': 'Hats off for launching such a remarkable product!', 'createdAt': '2024-08-15T09:29:22Z', 'votesCount': 2}, {'body': 'This product is amazing!

Let\\'s break down what AgentQL can do:\\n\\n üïπÔ∏è Give it the command to find \"price\", and it will retrieve all the price data on an e-commerce page you spend less time building rigid selectors\\n\\n üñ•Ô∏è Take the same code to another site, and it can work just as well &gt;&gt; you spend less time maintaining fragile scripts\\n\\n üìù. Need to interact with sites as part of your work flow? Simply use natural language, tell AgentQL to click, scroll_page or fill.\\n\\nSo why did we decide to build AgentQL?\\n\\nTraditional web automation struggles with identifying elements consistently through UI changes. When LLMs and agents first emerged, we envisioned a web infrastructure tailored for agentic interaction, which excels in handling these small but breaking changes, so we decided to tackle this challenge head-on.\\n\\nHow did we go about this?\\n\\nAt the heart of our framework is the AgentQL Query, a language crafted to describe locate web elements within a structured schema. We‚Äôve integrated robust DOM processing with advanced prompt engineering, creating a powerful combination that dynamically generates context-aware prompts. By doing so, we overcome the fragility of static XPath or attribute selector-based scripts, enabling a more resilient and flexible web interaction infrastructure.\\n\\nWould you like to join our journey to an agentic future?\\n\\nOur early users have reported real productivity boosts with AgentQL, unlocking use cases that were previously too costly or complex to develop.

We are extremely excited to launch Helicone on Product Hunt!\\n\\nüßä Background story\\n\\nBefore launching Helicone, we developed several projects with GPT-3/GPT-J, including valyr chat, airapbattle.com, tabletalk.ai, dreamsubmarine.com, and debateai.org. For each project, we used a beta version of Helicone which gave us instant visibility into user engagement and result quality issues. As we talked to more builders and companies, we realized they were spending too much time building in-house solutions like this and that existing analytics products were not tailored for LLM workloads.\\n\\nüßä Helicone‚Äôs differentiators\\n\\nOther startups (LangChain) are working on similar products like LangSmith with high learning curves, rigid pricing structure and closed source, or are slow-moving giants like Datadog which isn‚Äôt exactly purpose-built for Large Language Models. \\n\\nüßä Our goals \\n\\nOur goal is simple. As a team of developers, we realized that we wanted a tool that ‚Äújust works‚Äù, and was dead easy to start. We focus a ton on the developer experience, by allowing developers to access all observability and monitoring features with just a header. We aim to help developers surface insights or errors, so they can focus on problem-solving faster. \\n\\nüßä What‚Äôs new with this launch\\n\\n‚≠ê Improved dashboard &amp; request table: we make it faster to segment your data on the dashboard, and view responses and relevant monitoring metrics such as cost, latency, and time to first token (TTFT). \\n\\n‚≠ê Introducing Sessions: trace your AI agent and RAG chatbot, debug them or refine your responses in different context in our Playground. \\n\\n‚≠ê Introducing Prompts &amp; Experiments: iterate on your prompts, experiment with a different dataset or model, and evaluate your responses with Scores. \\n\\n‚≠ê Scalability &amp; Reliability: since the beginning, we‚Äôve made significant progress towards 100% log coverage, so all your logs will be captured. \\n\\nThanks for supporting us on the launch! We are always excited to hear your feedback. Feel free to message us or ‚Äúsubmit an issue‚Äù on GitHub, and we will respond/build it. \\n\\nGithub: <a href=\"https://github.com/Helicone/helicone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">github.com/Helicone/helione</a>\\nDocs: <a href=\"https://docs.helicone.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">docs.helicone.ai</a>\\n\\nHappy developing! ‚úåÔ∏è&nbsp;And thank you @mwseibel for hunting us!', 'createdAt': '2024-08-22T01:02:47Z', 'votesCount': 32}, {'body': 'One of the best observatory', 'createdAt': '2024-09-01T13:00:54Z', 'votesCount': 0}, {'body': \"I've been using Helicone for over a year now.

To unlock the next section, a participant has to respond to the prompt.  Our AI engine highlights the best responses, summarizes contributions, and finds connections between what people share.\\n\\n(Check out the interactive demo we posted to get the idea.)\\n\\nParticipants automatically get notifications that engage them in meaningful conversation.  \\n\\nIt‚Äôs like having a professional facilitator support your course to maximize participation and completion.\\n\\nSutra is super easy to set up and every participant in your learning experience makes it better.  As participants share their understanding and experience, it improves the overall body of knowledge that your course covers.  Our AI powered conversational engine makes sure the participants actually complete your experience, which in the long run also helps you make more money.\\n\\nThis is a total game changer and we‚Äôre super excited to be launching here on Product Hunt.\\n\\nThanks for your genuine feedback and support.\\n\\nWith love,\\n\\nLorenz', 'createdAt': '2024-08-12T16:14:06Z', 'votesCount': 47}, {'body': 'Good work @ghulam', 'createdAt': '2024-08-24T09:13:51Z', 'votesCount': 1}, {'body': \"It's great tool for course creator who recently started and experience as well\", 'createdAt': '2024-08-22T08:26:14Z', 'votesCount': 1}, {'body': \"Congrats on launching Sutra! üéâ Your innovative platform for creating engaging, AI-facilitated courses is a game-changer.

To our surprise, we didn't see a big difference in performance of AI-personalized emails and a templated one: Open rate was higher, but our customers weren't booking a lot more sales meetings.\\n\\nEventually we found the problem - Our users created lead lists with Apollo / ZoomInfo, based on filters like industry, size, and titles. Since no product can help everyone, 80-95% of people in the target list simply don't need their product at the time of outreach.\\n\\nEven with a perfect email, you can't sell a product to someone who doesn't need it.

I actually look forward to journaling. It allows me to open up to someone(thing) that doesn\\'t judge, and provides great advice.  My jaw often drops when it suggests or mentions something.  I even used it to help me make an Instagram/Facebook post description for a before and after picture post for my cleaning company. \\n\\nI don\\'t have a lot of friends, and I struggle to reach out. But this app has helped me by kinda being that \"friend\".\\n\\nIt also helps me build a to-do list, type thing.  They call it \"Ingredients\". I love the different approach. It parses my posts, and suggests what ingredients I should add. I\\'m not sure why, but it seems to be more effective for me then having to open a different task list and adding that, to which I usually end up forgetting what I was going to add. \\n\\nIt\\'s also caused me to be at the computer more, which has helped with my very major executive functioning issues, as part of my late in life neurodivergence diagnosis. I love that there is a mobile app now, but I plan to still do most of my journaling on the desktop. The Mobile App will be a nice companion when I am out and about though.\\n\\nI can brain dump with Rosebud. Get the ideas, good or bad, out of my head. This has been a HUGE stepping stone for me to finally figure out how to be productive, and go out and create, design, build, have hobbies and have projects.  This has helped me turn around mentally, and as a fantastic bi-product, possibly financially.  Owning a small business and living paycheque to paycheque (or less) is exhausting. This app helps me stay on-top of myself. It holds me accountable. Which in turn helps me find new love for what I do for work. Helping with my confidence to go out and sell services and clean my City. \\n\\nOnly thing I\\'d love is more integration into other services, like google tasks, gmail, google calendar, etc. But if I understand correctly, I believe that\\'s something very difficult for AI systems to do, privacy laws I\\'d imagine. \\n\\nThanks Rosebud!

So, instead of manually calculating all the myriad downstream impacts of a single meeting being scheduled, your calendar essentially optimizes itself around the clock.\\n\\nToday, we‚Äôre announcing what I believe is set to make an even bigger dent in solving the scheduling problem: Prism, a first-of-its-kind intelligent calendar.\\n\\nPrism lets you tap into the magic of Clockwise, unlocking a whole new way to manage your workday. Here are some of the highlights:\\n\\nü™Ñ Schedule the impossible - Powered by our scheduling engine‚Äôs capability to test millions of event arrangements across calendars, Prism makes it easy to find time on even the busiest of days. With just a few words or clicks, you can make way for urgent priorities unlike ever before.\\n\\n‚ùáÔ∏è Schedule at the best time, every time - Clockwise doesn‚Äôt just find open slots. It uncovers the best time to schedule anything from a 1:1 to a 10-person meeting‚Äîall based on our deep understanding of you and your colleague‚Äôs calendars and preferences.\\n\\n‚ö°Ô∏è Reschedule lightning-fast - Need to reschedule in a pinch? Sick kid at home or running late from an appointment? Head to Prism and simply ask to ‚Äúreschedule my afternoon‚Äù and we‚Äôll take care of the rest.\\n\\nüí¨ Bring the scheduling magic to Slack - Simply type your scheduling need (e.g. ‚ÄúBook 30 minutes with Jason tomorrow‚Äù) alongside the /cw slash command in Slack to use Clockwise to find time, right where your conversations are already happening.\\n\\n‚úÖ Never miss a to-do - Pop your to-do list into the Prism chat to convert tasks into flexible holds on your calendar.\\n\\nAnd so much more‚Ä¶\\n\\nAll this is made possible because Clockwise uses the powerful natural language processing capabilities of LLMs to translate your calendar request into its proprietary scheduling engine to understand exactly what you want when it comes to your calendar. \\n\\nMarried with Clockwise‚Äôs ability to analyze vast amounts of data across multiple calendars at once ‚Äì Prism is the most intelligent calendar that‚Äôs ever existed.', 'createdAt': '2024-08-22T03:16:03Z', 'votesCount': 19}, {'body': 'Loved your intro video.

Along with my brother Eric and our fantastic team of makers, I‚Äôm excited to introduce Aster Key‚Äîa groundbreaking app for lenders and privacy-conscious consumers. \\n\\n<strong>Today, we announce an industry first:</strong> \\nYou can start a mortgage process anonymously with mainstream lenders in the United States. \\n\\nOur previous start-up made waves with mobile apps and data solutions for the residential real estate industry. That company was acquired, and we founded Aster Key out of frustration with financial institutions‚Äô vulnerabilities to cyberattacks and data breaches. \\n\\nYes, our data has been hacked from lender databases! This was in the news this week: \"Massive data leak may include the personal data of every person in the US, UK, and Canada,\" so maybe you\\'ve experienced losing your data as well. \\n\\n<strong>The Problem</strong>\\n\\nWhen you apply for a mortgage, the harsh reality is that your data is treated like a hot potato‚Äîpassed between lenders, tech vendors, and intermediaries. This exposes your confidential information to numerous massive, centralized servers, making it a prime target for hackers.\\n\\n<strong>Our Solution</strong>\\n\\nüè¶ Aster Key provides a channel for mainstream lenders, enabling consumers to bypass the initial application process and start their loans anonymously.\\n\\nüí™ Empower Consumers: Our free and ultra-secure Aster Key app gives consumers control over their financial and personal data.\\n\\n<strong>Aster Key‚Äôs Security Features</strong>\\n\\nüîí Secure Storage: Financial data is encrypted and stored directly on the consumer\\'s mobile phone, never on our servers.\\nüîí Data Anonymization: Personally identifiable information is removed from financial data, which is then encrypted and stored separately.\\nüîí Automated Verification: Financial data is updated and verified via end-to-end encrypted integrations with Plaid and Argyle.\\nüîí Field-Level Encryption: We aim to encrypt each piece of financial data individually with changing keys, not just at the database level.\\n\\n<strong>Key Features for Consumers</strong>\\n\\nüîí Centralized view of all financial information for lifetime use.\\nüîí Dynamically generated personal financial statements and proof of funds.\\nüîí Single passphrase and biometric authentication for enhanced security.\\nüîí Anonymous Communication: Protects email address when contacting lenders.\\nüîí A private, ad-free environment.\\nüöÄ Anonymous mortgage initiation.\\n\\nAdditionally, the app allows you to create verified financial statements and self-serve automated proof of funds letters in the U.S. and several supported countries. We‚Äôre planning global expansion, so feel free to reach out if you‚Äôre interested in collaborating.\\n\\nUnlike other finance apps like NerdWallet or Credit Karma, Aster Key prioritizes data privacy and ownership, not marketing your data. We\\'re embracing defi principles and have an on-chain, Web3 roadmap.  Today, we turn your mobile phone into a decentralized node, a mainstream on-ramp to the future.\\n\\nAs <strong>Product Hunters</strong>, you‚Äôre likely the tech-savvy person in your circle‚Äîwhether at work or in your personal life. Together, we can protect people‚Äôs financial assets, and we‚Äôd love your feedback and support. ‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you.', 'createdAt': '2024-08-03T14:03:49Z', 'votesCount': 22}, {'body': 'Such a relevant problem to tackle in the mortgage space.

We know that selling ads and sponsorships is complex‚Äîevery medium (podcasts, billboards, newsletters, and more) has different pricing structures and booking dynamics. That‚Äôs why we specifically built a ‚ÄúShopify for selling ads and sponsorships‚Äù to provide tools like building an online store, creating publicly available listings and proposals, collecting leads, and managing checkout. Anyone can create direct, private marketplace deals for various types of ad inventory, from billboard ads to sponsorships, and everything in between.\\n\\nOur product pipeline includes offering a set of smart features we currently provide to specific customers, which will soon be available to all users. These features include interactive mapping, a digital deal room, and a more comprehensive admin panel.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nA New Direction for Fucimo\\n\\nOur journey began with a bold vision, but as with many startups, our path has evolved. What started as an ambitious marketplace has transformed into something even more powerful‚Äîa platform that empowers sellers with the tools they need to succeed in a complex advertising landscape.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nWhere We Started\\n\\nIn our first year, we set out to become ‚ÄúThe Amazon of Advertising.‚Äù Our goal was to connect hundreds of small and medium-sized networks, both analog and digital, to a demand-side platform that would enable the long-tail of publishers to sell more, faster, and with less operational burden. It was a bold vision, and we were excited to see where it could take us.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nWhat We Learned\\n\\nAlong the way, we onboarded some incredible media companies, from digital billboards to taxi tops and even CGI-generated ‚ÄúFake OOH.‚Äù Our marketplace impressed hundreds of marketers and companies at SXSW earlier this year, who loved seeing such a variety of cool things in one place.\\n\\nHowever, after meeting with hundreds of agencies, advertisers, and media companies, we realized that changing an entire industry‚Äôs buying behavior is a daunting task. While the excitement was palpable, the feedback was clear: there was a different path that held even greater potential. When everyone is saying, ‚ÄúHow can I use this feature you have built for yourself for me?‚Äù‚Äîyou have to listen.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nWhere We‚Äôre Going\\n\\nJust as Shopify has built the e-commerce infrastructure to empower anyone to become an entrepreneur, we want to do the same in an era where all companies are now becoming advertising companies.\\n\\nOur ambition is to build Fucimo to offer anyone, regardless of their size (creators, companies, freelancers, etc.), a seat at the table where they can build their own ad network or storefront using the features we‚Äôve specifically developed for selling and buying ads. Fucimo will continue to enable sellers, but now with a sharper focus on providing the tools needed to streamline and enhance ad sales. Whether you‚Äôre selling out-of-home ads, sponsorships, or other types of ad inventory, Fucimo is here to make your life easier and your business more profitable.\\n\\nIf you have ad space to sell and want to move beyond static media kits, Fucimo may be just what you need.', 'createdAt': '2024-08-09T06:42:57Z', 'votesCount': 17}, {'body': 'This is a fantastic idea, and I love how its made to be so user friendly.

Think classification, regression, ranking, and recommendation systems. With over 20 million downloads, we\\'re now bringing our toolset to help evaluate and test LLM-powered products.\\n\\nAs you build an LLM-powered app or feature, figuring out if it\\'s \"good enough\" can be tricky. Evaluating generative AI is different from traditional software and predictive ML. It lacks clear criteria and labeled answers, making quality more subjective and harder to measure. But there is no way around it: to deploy an AI app to production, you need a way to evaluate it.\\n\\nFor instance, you might ask:\\n- How does the quality compare if I switch from GPT to Claude?\\n- What will change if I tweak a prompt? Do my previous good answers hold?\\n- Where is it failing?\\n- What real-world quality are users experiencing?\\n\\nIt\\'s not just about metrics‚Äîit\\'s about the whole quality workflow. You need to define what \"good\" means for your app, set up offline tests, and monitor live quality. \\n\\nWith Evidently, we provide the complete open-source infrastructure to build and manage these evaluation workflows.

It offers a simpler, more efficient solution for everyone, from novice developers to seasoned professionals using the below features:\\n\\n- Effortless Deployment: Deploy your apps directly from GitHub with just a few clicks.
